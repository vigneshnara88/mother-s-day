    Amma ❤️

I just want to thank you for being such an amazing person. You’re always smiley and optimistic, even when times are hard, and you keep pushing me to become a better person every day. I’ll always remember everything you do for me — like being proactive about my health, cooking all the food I love (especially your மீன் குழம்பு even though you’re vegetarian), and the way you always scramble to take care of all of us after work.

Please always stay happy and cheerful, and don’t stress or overthink about the things around you. You deserve to take more time for yourself, to relax and enjoy life. I love you so much, Amma ❤️ Wishing you the happiest birthday filled with love, laughter, and amazing memories! 💖✨
